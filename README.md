A small unity prototype I made for [Kibe Software House](https://www.kibesh.com/) before converting the existing player controller
from being CharacterController based to being RigidBody based.
A whole devlog explaining why and how it was made can be found [here, as soon as I publish it](https://kyosukerui.neocities.org/)

## How to use open the project
Just download the whole repo, open UnityHub and select "Open" > "Add project from disk" and select the root folder of the project.
* The project was created with unity version 2020.3.25f1
* The project uses the Unity's new input system
